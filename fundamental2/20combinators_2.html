<!-- 
There are four different combinators in CSS:

Descendant Selector (space)
Child Selector (>)
Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
General Sibling Selector (~)
-->

<!-- The Child Selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element: Change the color of all <p> elements, that are immediate children of <div> elements, to "red". -->

<head>
    <style>
        div > p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
