<!-- 
There are four different combinators in CSS:

Descendant Selector (space)
Child Selector (>)
Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
General Sibling Selector (~)
-->

<!-- 
   The General Sibling Selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element: Change the color of the <p> elements that are siblings of a <div> element, to "red".
 -->

<head>
    <style>
        div ~ p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</body>
