<!-- 
There are four different combinators in CSS:

Descendant Selector (space)
Child Selector (>)
Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
General Sibling Selector (~)
-->

<!-- 
The Adjacent Sibling Selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

Change the color of the first <p> element that is directly after a <div> element, to "red". -->

<head>
    <style>
        div+p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</body>
